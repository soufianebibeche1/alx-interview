# Lockboxes Algorithm

## Overview
This project aims to develop an efficient algorithm to determine if all lockboxes can be opened given a set of keys. The solution involves applying concepts from graph theory and traversal algorithms.

## Concepts Needed
- **Lists and List Manipulation:** Understanding how to work with lists in Python, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.
- **Graph Theory Basics:** Knowledge of graph theory, particularly traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS), as the lockboxes and keys can be represented as nodes and edges in a graph.
- **Algorithmic Complexity:** Understanding the time and space complexity of the solution to write more efficient algorithms.
- **Recursion:** Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.
- **Queue and Stack:** Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial for implementing BFS or DFS algorithms.
- **Set Operations:** Utilizing sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.

## Requirements
- **Editors:** vi, vim, emacs
- **Interpreter/Compiler:** Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using Python 3.4.3
- **File Format:** All files should end with a new line and have the first line exactly as `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- **Documentation:** Code should be well-documented
- **Coding Style:** PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x) should be followed
- **Executable Files:** All files must be executable
- **README.md:** A mandatory README.md file at the root of the project directory
