# 0x05. N Queens

## Description

The N Queens problem is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics. The goal is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

## Concepts

To solve this problem, we need to understand several key concepts:

- **Backtracking Algorithms**: Used to explore all potential solutions to a problem and backtrack when a solution cannot be completed.
- **Recursion**: Recursive functions are essential for implementing backtracking algorithms.
- **List Manipulations in Python**: Lists are used to store the positions of queens on the board.
- **Python Command Line Arguments**: Handling command-line arguments with the `sys` module.
