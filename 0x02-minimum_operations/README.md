# Minimum Operations

## Description:
This project aims to devise an algorithmic solution to calculate the minimum number of operations required to achieve a given number of characters using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations. The problem involves understanding various algorithmic and mathematical concepts like dynamic programming, prime factorization, code optimization, greedy algorithms, and basic Python programming.
