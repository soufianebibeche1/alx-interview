# Rotate 2D Matrix

## Overview

In this project, you will implement an algorithm to rotate an `n x n` 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise in-place. This means you will manipulate the matrix directly without using extra space for another matrix. This task requires a good understanding of matrix manipulation, in-place operations, and Python's list-handling capabilities.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Represent and manipulate 2D matrices in Python.
- Perform in-place operations to optimize space complexity.
- Understand and implement matrix transposition.
- Reverse rows in a matrix as part of the rotation process.
- Use nested loops to manipulate elements within a 2D matrix.

## Key Concepts


### Matrix Representation in Python

2D matrix in Python is represented as a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row in the matrix. For example, a 3x3 matrix would be:
