# Pascal's Triangle Algorithm Project

## Overview

This project aims to implement Pascal's Triangle in Python. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients, named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal. Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two directly above it. The triangle starts with a single 1 at the top and each subsequent row is constructed by adding adjacent elements from the previous row.

## Algorithm

The algorithm for generating Pascal's Triangle involves creating a list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of the triangle. The first row contains a single element, which is 1. Subsequent rows are generated by summing adjacent elements from the previous row. The edges of the triangle always contain 1, and each row is symmetric.

## Implementation

To successfully complete this project, you should revise the following Python concepts:

- **Lists and List Comprehensions:** Understand how to create, access, modify, and iterate over lists. Utilize list comprehensions for generating rows of Pascal’s Triangle.
- **Functions:** Define and call functions, pass parameters, and return values, particularly returning a list of lists representing Pascal’s Triangle.
- **Loops:** Use for and while loops to iterate through sequences. Nested loops may be necessary for generating each row and calculating the values of Pascal’s Triangle.
- **Conditional Statements:** Apply conditions to implement logic based on the position within Pascal’s Triangle.
- **Recursion (Optional):** Understand recursion for generating Pascal’s Triangle rows.
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Perform addition for calculating each element of Pascal’s Triangle.
- **Indexing and Slicing:** Access elements and slices of lists.
- **Memory Management:** Be mindful of how lists are stored and copied.
- **Error and Exception Handling (Optional):** Use try-except blocks as needed.
- **Efficiency and Optimization:** Consider time and space complexity and apply optimizations.
